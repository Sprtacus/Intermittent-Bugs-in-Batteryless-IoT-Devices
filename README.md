# Intermittent Bugs in Batteryless IoT Devices
## Overview
This repository contains the seminar paper titled "Intermittent Bugs in Batteryless IoT Devices" authored by Marius Bendixen. The paper explores the challenges and solutions associated with intermittent bugs in IoT devices that operate without batteries. These devices rely on direct energy sources, which leads to frequent interruptions in their operation, causing unique programming challenges.

## Key Topics
**Batteryless IoT Devices:** Overview of devices that cannot store energy and must function with intermittent power.

**Intermittent Bugs:** Analysis of bugs that occur due to power interruptions, including Data Access Bugs, Activation Record Bugs, and Memory Map Bugs.

**Checkpoint Systems:** Examination of systems used to save the state of the device to ensure correct program execution after a power failure.

**Debugging Tools:** Discussion of tools like ScEpTIC designed to identify and mitigate intermittent bugs.

**Seminar Information**  
This paper was written as part of the seminar "Abstraktionen in Betriebssystemen" (Abstractions in Operating Systems) at the Technische Universität Dortmund in 2021.
